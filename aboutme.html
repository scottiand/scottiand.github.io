                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Scotti Anderson. I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest,
                 eventually going to school in the heart of the Willamette Valley at Willamette University. 
                There I found my passion for programming and recieved my Bachelor's in Computer Science. 
                During my education, I had the privilage to work on a wide variety of projects, including 
                several web applications and one cross-platform app, in addition to growing my skills as an 
                artist and a human being. 
                 </p>
                <p>
                    I am self practiced in pixel art, a digital art form based on drawing images at 
                    the pixel level. The style was born from old video games, where art assets 
                    had to folow limitations in file size and color count. Now, pixel art is not done 
                    out of necessity, but for its unique style and retro feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important aspect of my life is game design. I am interested in creating 
                    board games, card games, and other tabletop gaming experiences. As a programmer, 
                    I am particularly interested in how technology can be integrated with tabletop 
                    experiences to to create new gameplay possibilities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently exploring oppurtunities in the Salem, Portland, or Eugene area to start 
                    my career as a software engineer.
                </p>
